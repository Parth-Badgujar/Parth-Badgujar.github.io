### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Parth Badgujar aka `P3g4su5`

I'm a third-year undergraduate student in [**Electronics and Communication Engineering**](https://ece.iitr.ac.in) at [**IIT Roorkee**](https://www.iitr.ac.in).

Iâ€™m also a core member of [**Data Science Group IITR**](https://dsgiitr.in/) and an active CTF player in [**InfoSecIITR**](https://infoseciitr.in). My interests are :

- **Diffusion models** and **generative data modeling**  
- **AI security**, adversarial attacks, and robust ML systems  
- **CUDA** and **Triton kernel** development
- **Distributed inference/training**  
- **Binary exploitation** and **Linux Kernel exploitation**

I enjoy working on problems that blend deep learning with low-level performance and security â€” building systems that are both intelligent and resilient.
